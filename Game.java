/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 *  "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
 *  can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended 
 *  to make it more interesting!
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
 *  I have created new rooms, upadate the game and change the exits.
 *  Impleamented a new function printLocationInfo.
 *  I have implemented the direction of the exits.
 *  I have implemented the getLongDerection function.
 *  added a look command in the game.
 *  Added a new command in the game.
 *  Print all comand words.
 *  If press help button it will show a text field in a window.
